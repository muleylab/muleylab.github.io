Resources developed by our group

## Publications to Pathway mapping (pub2path)

[pub2path](https://github.com/vijaykumarmuley/pub2path/blob/main/README.md) is a R package to reconstruct biological pathway or process of your interest without a prior knowledge of gene functions from PubMed literature. Access will be given on request since pub2path manuscript is under preparation. CDSG database (see below) was created using pub2path results.

## Neurodegenerative Disease Gene Expression database (NDGEx)

[NDGEx](http://ndgex.lavis.unam.mx/) is a database of differential expression results in 25 neurodegenerative diseases from 155 independent microarray datasets. 

## Cell Death and Survival gene database (CDSG)

[CDSG](http://cdsg.lavis.unam.mx) ia a database of 8,380 predicted genes from 175 species linked with literature pub2path algorithm (unpublished) on cell death and survival.

## Escherichia coli functional protein-protein interactions (EcoFunPPI)

[EcofunPPI](http://www.cdfd.org.in/ecofunppi/) ia a database of functional protein-protein interactions in *Escherichia coli* K12 predicted using a combination of 9 machine learning methods. It is highly reliable database than several existing published database on PPI and could provide a experimentally testable hypothesis on proteins of interest.
