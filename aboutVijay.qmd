I am a computational biologist with expertise in bioinformatics, data science, and systems biology. My work focuses on understanding genes, proteins, cells, and protein–regulatory interaction networks across molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, immunology, evolution, and development.

I completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at CDFD, Hyderabad, and hold two M.Sc. degrees (Biotechnology and Bioinformatics). Over the past decade, I have worked as a researcher, staff scientist, and assistant professor across leading institutions in India, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, and France. My research experience spans epigenetics, gene-regulatory modeling, protein–protein interactions, immune signaling pathways, and systems-level studies of brain development and disease.

I have received national and international recognition, including the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores distinction from the National Council of Humanities, Sciences, and Technologies (CONAHCYT), Government of Mexico. I am currently affiliated with Inserm / Université Paris Cité, where I study multi-omics data integration, intergenic transcription, and gene-regulatory mechanisms in neuropsychiatric diseases.

For motivated individuals with a passion for research, I offer opportunities for student internships, collaborative projects, and scientific consulting. Feel free to contact me at **muleylab [at] gmail [dot] com**.
