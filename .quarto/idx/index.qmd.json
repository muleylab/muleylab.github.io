{"markdown":{"yaml":{"title":""},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nWelcome to the Laboratory of Organismal Science!\n\nWe study how genes work in different situations like diseases, cleaning the environment, and how living things survive in different conditions. We use advanced methods to look at big sets of data and find sets of genes that are important in these situations. We also look at how these genes work in specific parts of the body and how they interact with other genes. All this helps us understand how genes work and change over time to help living things survive and adapt.\n\nOur lab is at the forefront of innovation in computational biology and data science, constantly striving to push the boundaries of what is possible in order to improve human life and health. We are dedicated to uncovering new insights and discoveries that can make a meaningful impact in the field of medicine and healthcare.\n\nOur team is made up of highly skilled and passionate researchers who come from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, biology, statistics, and more. We work collaboratively to develop cutting-edge algorithms and tools that can be used to analyze complex biological data sets and uncover new insights about agriculture, disease and human health.\n\nWe are particularly excited about the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence to revolutionize the way we understand and treat human disease and crop yields. By training advanced models on large data sets, we are able to uncover patterns and relationships that would be impossible to detect using traditional methods.\n\nWe are also committed to sharing our findings with the scientific community, and regularly publish our research in leading journals and present our work at conferences and symposia around the world. We believe that by working together and sharing our knowledge, we can make the greatest impact in advancing human health and well-being.\n\nOur lab is always looking for new partners and collaborators to work with, and welcome anyone interested in joining our team or contributing to our research efforts. Together, we can continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in computational biology and data science and make a positive impact on the world.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":""},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
