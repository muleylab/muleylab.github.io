With a wealth of experience working in government and public universities in India, Germany, Ireland, and Mexico, I have a deep understanding of the advanced computational methods required to study the intricate inner workings of living organisms, cells, subcellular structures, genes, proteins, and their interactions.\n\nIn addition to my professional pursuits, I am also a lifelong learner, with a passion for writing books and invited book chapters, learning salsa and bachata dance, playing cricket or chess, reading science fiction books, watching movies, hiking mountains, and spending time in nature.\n\nIf you share my passion for using science and data to improve productivity and living standards, I would love to hear from you. Whether you are interested in research, internships, collaboration, or consultancy (paid), please don't hesitate to contact me via the social media links provided. I am always open to discussing new opportunities and exciting projects."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"aboutVijay.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Vijaykumar Muley, Ph.D.","about":{"template":"marquee","image":"chicago.jpeg","links":[{"icon":"orcid","text":"ORCID","href":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5329-600X"},{"icon":"loops","text":"Loops","href":"https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/534929/overview"},{"icon":"research-gate","text":"ResearchGate","href":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vijaykumar-Muley"},{"icon":"google","text":"GoogleScolar","href":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FoyJkwcAAAAJ&hl=en"},{"icon":"facebook","text":"facebook","href":"https://www.facebook.com/vijaykumar.muley.1"},{"icon":"twitter","text":"twitter","href":"https://twitter.com/vijaykumarmuley"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaykumarmuley/"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/vijaykumarmuley"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
