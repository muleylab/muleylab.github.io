Access will be given on request since pub2path manuscript is under preparation. CDSG database (see below) was created using pub2path results.\n\n## Neurodegenerative Disease Gene Expression database (NDGEx)\n\n[NDGEx](http://ndgex.lavis.unam.mx/) is a database of differential expression results in 25 neurodegenerative diseases from 155 independent microarray datasets. \n\n## Cell Death and Survival gene database (CDSG)\n\n[CDSG](http://cdsg.lavis.unam.mx) ia a database of 8,380 predicted genes from 175 species linked with literature pub2path algorithm (unpublished) on cell death and survival.\n\n## Escherichia coli functional protein-protein interactions (EcoFunPPI)\n\n[EcofunPPI](http://www.cdfd.org.in/ecofunppi/) ia a database of functional protein-protein interactions in *Escherichia coli* K12 predicted using a combination of 9 machine learning methods. It is highly reliable database than several existing published database on PPI and could provide a experimentally testable hypothesis on proteins of interest.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"resources.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Resources","listing":{"contents":"posts","type":"grid","sort":"date desc","categories":true}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
