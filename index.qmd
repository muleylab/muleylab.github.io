##  

We study how genes work in different situations like diseases, cleaning the environment, and how living things survive in different conditions. We use advanced methods to look at big sets of data and find sets of genes that are important in these situations. We also look at how these genes work in specific parts of the body and how they interact with other genes. All this helps us understand how genes work and change over time to help living things survive and adapt.
