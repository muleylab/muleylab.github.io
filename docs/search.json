We focus on identifying context-dependent genes, known as genetic modules, and investigating their physiological roles in various contexts such as diseases, bioremediation, the nitrogen cycle, and responses to different biotic and abiotic factors. We also study tissue- and cell-specific gene expression, regulation, and intra- and intercellular interactions between genes and their protein products. Additionally, we use comparative genomics to trace the evolutionary history of these genetic modules, with the ultimate goal of understanding their organization during adaptation, embryonic development, and pathological conditions."

We use computational tools and methods to study and map out these interactions to understand how they contribute to the overall function of the cell (Muley and Acharya, 2012, Muley, Ph.D. thesis, 2012). This knowledge can be used to develop new drugs, identify new drug targets, and improve our understanding of diseases and the functioning of cells.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Protein-protein interactions subnetworks associated with cell surface regulates bacterial cell division\n\n\nIn addition to studying interactions within a cell, we are also interested in understanding protein interactions between cells. These interactions play a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell communication, growth, and differentiation and are involved in both normal and disease processes. Understanding intercellular interactions has potential applications in medicine, such as developing new drugs and therapies that target these interactions."

    "text": "Functional and Developmental neurobiology\nDevelopmental neurobiology is a field of study that focuses on the development and maturation of the nervous system. It encompasses the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation and function of the brain and spinal cord.\nThe cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for many functions such as consciousness, movement, sensation, perception, reasoning, and memory. The cerebrum develops from a structure called the telencephalon, which is a part of the embryonic brain. During embryonic development, the cerebrum is formed from a structure called the neural plate, which is a sheet of cells that folds and develops into the three primary brain vesicles: the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon develops into the telencephalon, which gives rise to the cerebrum.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFigure 3: Brain and its extensions throughout body (left panel). A closuer look at the the hypothalamus and its connection with the pituitary gland (right panel), which together plays a critical role in regulating many of the body’s physiological processes.\n\n\nLineage specific divergence refers to the process by which different species or lineages of organisms evolve different characteristics or features. In the case of the cerebrum, different lineages of animals, such as birds and mammals, have developed different characteristics in their cerebrum despite having a similar developmental origin. The molecular pathways that control cerebrum development in birds and mammals diverge, leading to the formation of distinct structures and functions. This divergence is thought to have occurred as a result of different selective pressures and adaptations to different environments. We have identified molecular pathways that are relevant to these differences, and we have provided evidence for the possible origins of neuropsychiatric diseases due to impaired cerebrum development (Muley et.al., 2020). We are currently developing a computational framework to address some long-standing questions in biology, such as the spatiotemporal map of protein-protein interactions that connect brain-driven processes to various organs in the body during development and the formation of neural circuits."

    "text": "Evolutionary biology\nEvolutionary biology is the study of how living things have changed and developed over time. It uses information from different areas of science to understand how life on Earth began and how it has changed. The main idea is that all living things come from a common ancestor and have grown and changed through natural processes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The distribution of about PDZ domain containing proteins across 1,476 microbial genomes (left panel), their classification (middle panel), and the evolutionary origin (right)\n\n\nOur goal is to investigate the distribution and evolution of protein domains, such as the PDZ domain, across different genomes. The PDZ domain is particularly challenging to study due to its high sequence divergence and frequent combination with other domains in proteins (Figure 4). Our previous research on PDZ domain-containing proteins from over 1400 microbial genomes led us to propose a link between their evolution and the development of multicellularity and organismal complexity (Muley et.al., 2019). We also assigned potential functions to many previously uncharacterized protein families, and proposed their last universal common ancestor. Currently, we are expanding our research to include PDZ domains from animals, plants and viruses and to the highly ubiquitous haloacid domain in over 17,000 genomes across the three domains of life and viruses. These domains play critical roles in regulating important signaling pathways involved in embryonic development, synaptic signaling, and metabolism relevant to human health."

This approach aims to understand the underlying mechanisms of diseases using computational methods and data from multiple sources, and to identify the complex interactions between genes, proteins, and other biomolecules that contribute to disease development and progression. By taking a systems-level approach, we are able to identify new insights and connections that might not have been apparent from traditional reductionist methods, leading to a better understanding of the underlying causes of diseases and new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

    "text": "I received my B.Sc. degree in Chemistry, Zoology, and Fishery Science in 2000 and my M.Sc. in Biotechnology in 2002 from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad, India. In 2005, I completed my second M.Sc. degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Pune in Pune, India. In 2012, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Bioinformatics from the Computational and Functional Genomics Laboratory at the Centre for Fingerprinting and DNA Diagnostics (CDFD) in Hyderabad, India, under the supervision of Dr. Akash Ranjan.\nIn April 2012, I joined the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune, India as a postdoctoral scientist in Dr. Sanjeev Galande’s laboratory, where I worked on animal evolution, embryonic development, and epigenetic regulation. In October 2013, I moved to Jena, Germany as a staff scientist and worked on mathematical modeling of gene expression and regulation in breast cancers at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, in the Network Modelling group headed by Professor Rainer Koenig. In February 2016, I was appointed as an assistant professor on a permanent basis at the Central University of Punjab in Bathinda, India in the Centre for Computational Sciences. However, I resigned from the position after a while and decided to work as a full-time researcher at University College Cork, National University of Ireland in Cork City, Ireland from September 2017. There, I worked on IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha signaling pathways involved in immune responses with Dr. Ken Nally. In April 2018, I was invited to join the Institute of Neurobiology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Queretaro, Mexico, as an assistant professor and senior scientist in the neural laboratory of neural development headed by Professor Alfredo Varela. At UNAM, I worked on various research projects in the field of neurobiology and studied the molecular basis of embryonic brain development, neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative and infectious diseases at the systems level. The National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), Government of Mexico, awarded me with a lifetime honorary distinction called Sistema Nacional de Investigadores nivel 1 (System of National Investigator level 1) and fellowship for three subsequent years. I resgined from the UNAM in November 2022 and will be start working again soon.\nI have published several research papers, book chapters, and a book in prestigious journals from Nature, Oxford, Elsevier, Springer, BioMedCentral, PLoS, and Frontiers publication houses. Currently, I have contracts to write and edit two books. I am also an editorial board member of Frontiers and Dove Medical Press journals and review research manuscripts for over 30 journals. I have received several national and international fellowships by competition, including UGC-NET, DBT-JRF, and UGC-JRF from the Indian government, travel fellowships from the European Science Foundation, and the International Society for Computational Biologists."
